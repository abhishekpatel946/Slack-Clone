# Slack Clone

### Description
- Slack-Clone is a clone of a slack. Implemented using React and Firebase.
- Behind the backend, I was used React-Firebase for authentication with Google-auth, and highly secure specially for non-authorized users. 
- And I have developed a channel section to add new channels and communicate through these channels.
- I have used firestore to keep store all the messages spread among the channels or community. 
- And ofcourse our database will be safe under google-firebase security so no worries about securities.

### Features
- The channels or messages are stored in firestore database so quickly accessible via our app.
- I was used react-router-dom for saving server-side loads or refreshing. this functionality improve the speed for redirect to one component to another without refreshing from  server-side it makes life easier, save lots of time and fast to switch without loading or refreshing the whole page.
- Our data will be in real-time, if any changes make happens in messages or channels then it will automatically changes in our app in real-time no need to refresh our page.
the app will be responsive like if you used in Desktop or Mobile devices it render same thing.
